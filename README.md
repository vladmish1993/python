# My hobby Python projects
### sudoku.py 
Simple sudoku generator.
### tg_bot.py 
The first version has been writen by me with PHP, but then I will rewrite it with Python and designed as chat-bot for Telegram.
Bot for telegram, which shows the cheapest return flights from a specific city. It interacts with different flight APIs, which are located in the "classes" folder, and gets the cheapest flight.
